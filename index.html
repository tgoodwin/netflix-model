		<h1>Conceptual Model of a Netflix Stream</h1>
		<div class="description">This model seeks to map a supply chain of your nightly habit, an hour of Netflix before bed. The vertical bar below represents a spatial timeline, tracing the spatial journey of tonight's episode from its origins as a video file to its final destination in your browser. Nodes along the vertical axis are timestamped to illustrate how the stream's supply chain exists in the time before and after you hit 'Play Now.'</div>

				<h2>The Open Connect Appliance (OCA)</h2>
				<p>The physical content server that was installed by Netflix at your local ISP's data center. It contains multiple hard drives which together hold between 100 and 200TB of Netflix content. This is the literal machine that is serving your video stream to you in real-time. Every day, it also downloads ~7.5Tb of new video data from Netflix during off-peak hours. Your ISP agrees to pay for the electricity it uses because it spares them of the Netflix thru-traffic they would be handling otherwise.</p>

				<h2>Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h2>
				<p>The company to whom you pay a monthly bill, and who operates and maintains the network in your local area. Netflix has partnered with your ISP by installing OCAs in their regional data centers. One OCA somewhere in your ISP's network received the video you've chosen to stream within a content shipment from Netflix's Transcoding Repository. This OCA then replicated the files in this shipment onto every other OCA in your ISP's network, including the one streaming video to your device.</p>

				<h2>The Internet Backbone</h2>
				<p>The vast network of fiber and coaxial cabling that connects ISPs together. Your stream is not currently migrating across these cables. However, the source data for your stream was shipped across these cables to an OCA in your ISP's network during an off-peak time to avoid competing with other backbone traffic (generally 2AM to noon, your local time).</p>

				<h2>The Netflix Transcoding Repository</h2>
				<p>A centralized Netflix operations center somewhere in North America. Here, all of Netflix's content is encoded as video files and routed to certain global regions before being deployed across Internet backbone links. This is the origin of all physical video files before they are pre-positioned around the world.</p>
